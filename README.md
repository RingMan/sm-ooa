An experimental DSL for describing a Schlaer-Mellor Object-Oriented Analysis

As you can see, there is absolutely no source code yet.  This is just my public playground for toying
with ideas related to OOA.

The DSL would be used to define entities such as Domains, Subsystems, Objects, and Lifecycles.

Possible uses would be to use the DSL as a textual alternative to a CASE tool for doing OOA.  The DSL could
be used to generate files to feed to tools like graphviz for creating diagrams from the DSL.

Another use would be to generate code from the OOA.

Yet another use is to define objects just enough to create a database from them and/or define relationships
just enough to automate joins in SQL queries.

That's it for now.
